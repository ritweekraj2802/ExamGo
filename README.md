# ExamGo

INTRODUCTION: <br>
This Web Application provides a facility to conduct online examinations. It saves time as it allows a number of Users to give the exam at a time and displays the results as 
the test gets over, so no need to wait for the result.The  Online Examination System is a web-based  application  .   The system suits the needs of Educational Institutions, 
Primary and Secondary Schools, Colleges, Professional Institutes, Universities or Training Academies. The Online Examination System is easy to use, has a fully-featured and flexible Testing, Examination and Assessment web portal. It allows Administrators to set examinations and questions for registered students.<br>
<br>
This project is based on the successful creation and implementation of a quiz taking Portal called ExamGo  . This system allows students to give quizzes and   prevents any malpractice in academic quiz taking. The teachers can create a quiz and also control  which student is        blocked/unblocked from taking a quiz based on their discretion. Additionally, if a student tries to navigate out of a tab in the exam or in any way break the equilibrium of the environment the system immediates blocks their access and only their teacher can grant them re-access to the quiz. This system has been designed to combat the existing problems seen by us in quiz taking and how it harms students who choose to do them honestly.<br>

MOTIVATION: <br>

Nowadays, in these dreaded times of the pandemic it’s difficult for teachers to conduct a smooth and problem free eLearning experience especially the examination part. A robust while a simple subtle e-learning experience is what is the need of the hour. Keeping this is in mind we decided to create an eExamination system which will be beneficial for many students and teachers who will now have no worries in conducting small quizzes or showing students results. That is the thought we have tried to implement behind this project. <br>
